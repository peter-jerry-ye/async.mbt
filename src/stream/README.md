# Stream

This package provides abstraction for Streams, including readable streams and writable streams.

The goal is to provide an abstraction for stream in Node.js, stream in wasi-io, and other IO-related library, such as libuv.

With the foundation, there will be higher level operations, such as buffered streams, text streams, etc.
